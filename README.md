# A Jupyter Notebook for testing Binder

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a software that creates a Docker container able to run Notebooks interactively from the web.

The **ipyleaflet_maps.ipynb** file is a notebook for testing Binder implementation with [Ipyleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet) package.


The notebook is running at:

For some reason unknown to me, the maps are not displayed well when you open/run the notebook. Thus, it is needed to re-run all code chunks to get proper results.
